# Downloading APK Files

My first Attempt was to setup a KOPLAYER instance and download the APK File
within the instance which seemed handy for me since I could start it using
the same instance.

The problem with this is that some APK files may not be downloadable since
the installation on tablets is not possible, to change the Type of KOPLAYER
did not change that.
This is due to the restriction of some Applications that they don't run on
tablets or only in certain regions and so on...

To still get the app we can use the Chrome plugin "APK Downloader", here
we just paste in the URL from Google Play and download the APK file.
